# üåê Proof of Putt Website Development Log

**Date:** August 29, 2025
**Project:** Proof of Putt Website
**Status:** In Progress

---

## **Phase 1: Project Scaffolding & Initial Setup**

### **1.1. Next.js Project Initialization**
- **Command:** `npx create-next-app@latest proofofputt-website --typescript --eslint --tailwind --src-dir --app --no-turbopack --import-alias "@/*"`
- **Reasoning:** A full-featured, modern web stack was chosen to reflect the technical excellence of the project.
  - **Next.js (App Router):** Provides a robust framework with server-side rendering, static site generation, and excellent performance. The App Router is the latest standard for building Next.js applications.
  - **TypeScript:** Ensures type safety and improves developer experience, which is crucial for a project of this complexity.
  - **ESLint:** Enforces code quality and consistency.
  - **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid development of modern and responsive user interfaces.
  - **`src` directory & `@/*` alias:** Organizes the codebase and provides clean import paths.

### **1.2. Directory Structure**
- A new directory `proofofputt-website` has been created at the root of the repository. This keeps the website project separate from the main application's backend and desktop code, but within the same project context.

## **Phase 2: Basic Page Structure and Layout**

### **2.1. Components Creation**
- **`Header.tsx`:** Created a navigation header with links to all main pages.
- **`Footer.tsx`:** Created a simple footer with copyright information.

### **2.2. Layout Integration**
- **`src/app/layout.tsx`:** Modified the root layout to include the `Header` and `Footer` components, ensuring a consistent look and feel across all pages. Updated metadata and added global styling classes.

### **2.3. Page File Creation**
- **`src/app/page.tsx`:** Cleaned up and added placeholder content for the Home page.
- **`src/app/features/page.tsx`:** Created with placeholder content.
- **`src/app/technology/page.tsx`:** Created with placeholder content.
- **`src/app/roadmap/page.tsx`:** Created with placeholder content.
- **`src/app/blog/page.tsx`:** Created with placeholder content.
- **`src/app/developers/page.tsx`:** Created with placeholder content.

## **Phase 3: Content Population**

### **3.1. Home Page (`src/app/page.tsx`)**
- **Content Source:** `Technical.Engineering.Portfolio.Brief.8.29.md`
- **Key Information:** Project overview, core innovation (AI-powered sports analytics, tamper-proof data), and the vision for asynchronous, virtual putting competition.

### **3.2. Features Page (`src/app/features/page.tsx`)**
- **Content Source:** `Technical.Engineering.Portfolio.Brief.8.29.md`, `Launch.Campaign.Strategy.8.29.md`
- **Key Information:** Detailed features including AI-powered putting analysis (YOLO, real-time processing, ROI, putt classification), cross-platform experience (Desktop, Web, Mobile), engaging competition (duels, leagues, verifiable data, freemium), and advanced analytics.

### **3.3. Technology Page (`src/app/technology/page.tsx`)**
- **Content Source:** `Technical.Engineering.Portfolio.Brief.8.29.md`, `Desktop.Web.Integration.Guide.8.28.md`
- **Key Information:** Comprehensive technical stack (Computer Vision & AI, Cross-Platform Development, Backend Architecture, Cloud Infrastructure & DevOps), architectural design excellence (modularity, scalability, security), and detailed desktop-web integration.

### **3.4. Roadmap Page (`src/app/roadmap/page.tsx`)**
- **Content Source:** `2026.Financial.Innovation.Roadmap.8.29.md`, `Launch.Campaign.Strategy.8.29.md`
- **Key Information:** 2026 financial innovation roadmap (decentralized escrow, fee optimization, regulatory compliance), 12-month business forecast (revenue streams, implementation roadmap), and long-term vision (Bitcoin-powered ecosystem).

### **3.5. Blog Page (`src/app/blog/page.tsx`)**
- **Content Source:** Titles and summaries from various reports in `Claude.Takeover.Reports`.
- **Key Information:** A list of recent news and updates, acting as a simple blog roll.

### **3.6. For Developers Page (`src/app/developers/page.tsx`)**
- **Content Source:** `Desktop.Developer.Onboarding.Template.8.29.md`, `Private.Developer.Access.Strategy.8.29.md`, `Desktop.App.Secret.Protection.Strategy.8.29.md`
- **Key Information:** Developer onboarding checklist, security & access strategy (information classification, proprietary code protection), technical setup, and development guidelines.

## **Phase 4: Styling Refinement**

### **4.1. Global CSS Cleanup**
- **`src/app/globals.css`:** Removed redundant `:root` and `body` styles, and the `@theme inline` block, to rely solely on Tailwind CSS for styling. This ensures a cleaner and more consistent styling approach.

### **4.2. Component and Page Styling Review**
- **`Header.tsx` & `Footer.tsx`:** Reviewed and confirmed that existing styling is consistent and polished, requiring no further changes.
- **`src/app/page.tsx` (Home Page):** Added `p-6 bg-gray-900 rounded-lg shadow-lg` to each `section` tag for better visual separation and consistency with other pages.
- **`src/app/features/page.tsx`:** Reviewed and confirmed that existing styling is consistent and polished, requiring no further changes.
- **`src/app/technology/page.tsx`:** Reviewed and confirmed that existing styling is consistent and polished, requiring no further changes.
- **`src/app/roadmap/page.tsx`:** Reviewed and confirmed that existing styling is consistent and polished, requiring no further changes.
- **`src/app/blog/page.tsx`:** Reviewed and confirmed that existing styling is consistent and polished, requiring no further changes.
- **`src/app/developers/page.tsx`:** Reviewed and confirmed that existing styling is consistent and polished, including the colored circles for information classification, requiring no further changes.
