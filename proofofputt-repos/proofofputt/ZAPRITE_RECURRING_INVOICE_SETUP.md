## Implementation Components

### 1. Zaprite Client Functions (`app/utils/zaprite-client.js`)

#### New Functions Added

**Create Recurring Invoice:**
```javascript
createZapriteRecurringInvoice(invoicePayload, options)
```
- **Endpoint:** `POST /v1/invoice/recurring`
- **Purpose:** Create monthly recurring subscription
- **Returns:** Invoice object with checkout URL

**Cancel Recurring Invoice:**
```javascript
cancelZapriteRecurringInvoice(invoiceId, options)
```
- **Endpoint:** `POST /v1/invoice/recurring/{invoiceId}/cancel`
- **Purpose:** Stop automatic billing

**Get Recurring Invoice:**
```javascript
getZapriteRecurringInvoice(invoiceId, options)
```
- **Endpoint:** `GET /v1/invoice/recurring/{invoiceId}`
- **Purpose:** Check invoice status

---

### 2. Subscription Order Endpoint (`app/api/subscriptions/create-zaprite-order.js`)

#### Updated Logic

**Monthly Subscription Flow:**
```javascript
if (interval === 'monthly') {
  // Use recurring invoice for automatic monthly billing
  const recurringPayload = {
    customerId: user.player_id.toString(),  // player_id as customer reference
    customerEmail: user.email,
    customerName: user.display_name || `Player ${user.player_id}`,
    amount: 2.10,
    currency: 'USD',
    interval: 'monthly',
    intervalCount: 1,  // Bill every 1 month
    startDate: new Date().toISOString(),
    description: 'Proof of Putt Monthly Subscription',
    metadata: {
      userId: user.player_id.toString(),
      playerId: user.player_id.toString(),  // Explicit reference
      userEmail: user.email,
      interval: 'monthly',
      subscriptionType: 'proof-of-putt'
    },
    successUrl: `${FRONTEND_URL}/subscription/success?session_id={ORDER_ID}`,
    cancelUrl: `${FRONTEND_URL}/settings?canceled=true`
  };

  zapriteData = await createZapriteRecurringInvoice(recurringPayload);
}
```

**Annual Subscription Flow:**
```javascript
else if (interval === 'annual') {
  // Direct redirect to payment link (lifetime early adopter)
  window.location.href = 'https://pay.zaprite.com/pl_NC6B3oH3dJ';
}
```

---

### 3. Webhook Handler (`app/api/webhooks/zaprite.js`)

#### New Event Handlers

**Invoice Paid (`invoice.paid` or `recurring_invoice.paid`):**
- Activates/extends subscription
- Updates `subscription_current_period_end` to NOW() + 30 days
- Sets `subscription_status = 'active'`
- Defaults `zaprite_payment_method` to 'square'

**Invoice Payment Failed (`invoice.payment_failed`):**
- Sets `subscription_status = 'past_due'`
- Logs failure reason
- TODO: Send email notification

**Invoice Created (`invoice.created`):**
- Logs upcoming charge
- TODO: Send email notification about upcoming payment

#### Updated Player ID Extraction

The webhook now checks multiple sources for player_id in priority order:
1. `eventData.metadata.playerId` (new consistent format)
2. `eventData.metadata.userId` (legacy format)
3. `eventData.metadata.player_id` (alternate format)
4. `eventData.customerId` (direct customer ID)
5. `eventData.customer.id` (nested customer ID)
6. `eventData.customer.metadata.playerId`
7. Email lookup as fallback

---

## Customer ID Consistency

### Ensuring player_id Usage Throughout

All Zaprite integrations now consistently use `player_id` as the customer identifier:

**Subscription Orders:**
```javascript
customerId: user.player_id.toString()
metadata: {
  userId: user.player_id.toString(),
  playerId: user.player_id.toString()  // Explicit reference
}
```

**Bundle Purchases:**
```javascript
customerId: user.player_id.toString()
metadata: {
  userId: user.player_id.toString(),
  playerId: user.player_id.toString()  // Added for consistency
}
```

**Webhook Processing:**
- Extracts `player_id` from multiple possible locations
- Falls back to email lookup if needed
- Updates `players` table with correct `player_id`

---

## Database Schema

### Players Table Fields

```sql
-- Customer identifiers
zaprite_customer_id VARCHAR(255),           -- Zaprite's customer ID (maps to player_id)
zaprite_subscription_id VARCHAR(255),       -- Recurring invoice/subscription ID
zaprite_payment_method VARCHAR(50),         -- 'square', 'bitcoin', 'lightning'

-- Subscription status
subscription_status VARCHAR(50),            -- 'active', 'past_due', 'canceled'
subscription_tier VARCHAR(50),              -- 'full_subscriber'
subscription_billing_cycle VARCHAR(50),     -- 'monthly', 'annual'
is_subscribed BOOLEAN,                      -- Quick check flag

-- Billing periods
subscription_started_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
subscription_current_period_start TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
subscription_current_period_end TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
subscription_expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,

-- Cancellation
subscription_cancel_at_period_end BOOLEAN
```

### Zaprite Events Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE zaprite_events (
  event_id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  zaprite_event_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  event_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,  -- 'invoice.paid', 'invoice.payment_failed', etc.
  player_id INTEGER REFERENCES players(player_id),
  zaprite_customer_id VARCHAR(255),

  processed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  processed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  processing_error TEXT,
  retry_count INT DEFAULT 0,
  received_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

---

## User Flow

### Monthly Subscription Purchase

```
1. User clicks "Subscribe Monthly" ($2.10/month)
   └─> Frontend calls POST /api/subscriptions/create-zaprite-order
       └─> Body: { interval: 'monthly' }

2. Backend creates Zaprite recurring invoice
   └─> API: POST /v1/invoice/recurring
       └─> Payload includes player_id as customerId
           └─> Returns checkoutUrl

3. User redirected to Zaprite checkout
   └─> Enters Square payment details (credit/debit card)
       └─> Opts in to save payment method for recurring billing
           └─> Completes payment

4. Zaprite sends webhook: invoice.paid
   └─> Webhook handler processes event
       └─> Extracts player_id from metadata
           └─> Updates players table:
               - is_subscribed = TRUE
               - subscription_expires_at = NOW() + 30 days
               - subscription_tier = 'full_subscriber'
               - zaprite_payment_method = 'square'

5. User gains immediate access to subscription features
   └─> Subscription auto-renews monthly
       └─> Zaprite charges saved payment method
           └─> Webhook extends period by 30 days
```

### Recurring Billing Cycle

```
Month 1 (Initial):
- User pays $2.10
- Webhook: invoice.paid → subscription_current_period_end = Nov 12

Month 2 (Auto-renewal):
- Zaprite charges saved card automatically
- Webhook: invoice.paid → subscription_current_period_end = Dec 12

Month 3, 4, 5... (Continues):
- Automatic billing continues until user cancels
- Each successful payment extends subscription by 30 days
```

### Failed Payment Handling

```
If payment fails:
1. Zaprite sends webhook: invoice.payment_failed
2. Webhook sets subscription_status = 'past_due'
3. User receives email notification
4. Zaprite retries payment according to retry schedule
5. If all retries fail, subscription expires
```

## Testing Checklist

### 1. Monthly Subscription Creation

```bash
# Test API endpoint
curl -X POST https://app.proofofputt.com/api/subscriptions/create-zaprite-order \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "interval": "monthly"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "checkoutUrl": "https://zaprite.com/checkout/xyz",
  "orderId": "invoice_abc123",
  "interval": "monthly",
  "amount": 2.10,
  "currency": "USD",
  "isRecurring": true,
  "playerId": 123
}
```

### 2. Complete Payment Flow

- [ ] Click "Subscribe Monthly" on settings page
- [ ] Redirected to Zaprite checkout
- [ ] Enter Square payment details
- [ ] Opt in to save payment method
- [ ] Complete payment
- [ ] Redirected back to success page
- [ ] Check database: `is_subscribed = TRUE`
- [ ] Check subscription_expires_at is 30 days from now

### 3. Webhook Processing

```sql
-- Check webhook was received
SELECT * FROM zaprite_events
WHERE event_type = 'invoice.paid'
AND player_id = YOUR_PLAYER_ID
ORDER BY received_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Check subscription activated
SELECT
  player_id,
  is_subscribed,
  subscription_status,
  subscription_tier,
  subscription_expires_at,
  zaprite_payment_method
FROM players
WHERE player_id = YOUR_PLAYER_ID;
```

### 4. Recurring Payment Simulation

**Cannot test without waiting 30 days, but verify:**
- [ ] Zaprite dashboard shows recurring invoice status
- [ ] Payment method is saved and visible in dashboard
- [ ] Next billing date is correct
- [ ] User can view subscription details in settings

### 5. Cancellation Flow

```javascript
// Test subscription cancellation
const response = await fetch('/api/player/123/subscription/cancel', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  }
});
```

**Expected Result:**
- [ ] `subscription_cancel_at_period_end = TRUE`
- [ ] Subscription remains active until current period ends
- [ ] Zaprite stops auto-renewal
- [ ] User receives confirmation

---

## Zaprite Dashboard Configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invalid API endpoint" error

**Solution:**
The exact recurring invoice endpoint may vary. Try these alternatives:
- `/v1/invoice/recurring`
- `/v1/recurring-invoice`
- `/v1/subscription`

Contact Zaprite support to confirm correct endpoint.

### Issue: Webhook not receiving events

**Check:**
1. Webhook URL is publicly accessible (not localhost)
2. Webhook secret matches in `.env`
3. Zaprite dashboard shows delivery attempts
4. Check Vercel logs: `vercel logs --filter="zaprite"`

### Issue: player_id not found in webhook

**Check:**
1. Metadata includes `playerId` field in order creation
2. Webhook extraction logic covers all possible locations
3. Email lookup is working as fallback

### Issue: Recurring payment not processing

**Check:**
1. User's payment method is saved in Zaprite
2. Recurring invoice status is "active" not "paused"
3. No payment failures in Zaprite dashboard
4. Webhook is receiving `invoice.paid` events

## Monitoring Queries

### Check Active Recurring Subscriptions

```sql
SELECT
  player_id,
  email,
  subscription_status,
  subscription_billing_cycle,
  subscription_current_period_end,
  zaprite_payment_method,
  zaprite_subscription_id
FROM players
WHERE subscription_billing_cycle = 'monthly'
  AND is_subscribed = TRUE
ORDER BY subscription_current_period_end ASC;
```

### Check Recent Recurring Payments

```sql
SELECT
  ze.event_id,
  ze.event_type,
  ze.player_id,
  p.email,
  ze.payment_amount,
  ze.payment_method,
  ze.received_at,
  ze.processed
FROM zaprite_events ze
JOIN players p ON ze.player_id = p.player_id
WHERE ze.event_type IN ('invoice.paid', 'recurring_invoice.paid')
ORDER BY ze.received_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Check Failed Payments

```sql
SELECT
  ze.player_id,
  p.email,
  ze.event_type,
  ze.processing_error,
  ze.received_at
FROM zaprite_events ze
JOIN players p ON ze.player_id = p.player_id
WHERE ze.event_type IN ('invoice.payment_failed', 'payment.failed')
ORDER BY ze.received_at DESC;
```

### Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as active_monthly_subscribers,
  COUNT(*) * 2.10 as monthly_recurring_revenue
FROM players
WHERE subscription_billing_cycle = 'monthly'
  AND is_subscribed = TRUE
  AND subscription_status = 'active';
```
