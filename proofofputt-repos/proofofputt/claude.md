## End-to-End Data Flow Documentation

### Complete Session Data Journey
```
[Desktop App] 
    ↓ (Session Recording & CV Analysis)
[Real-time Calculations]
    ↓ (Session Statistics Object)
[API Upload via POST /api/upload-session]
    ↓ (Data Validation & Processing)
[PostgreSQL Database (NeonDB)]
    ↓ (Query via API endpoints)
[Web Dashboard Display]
    ↓ (Formatted User Interface)
[Competition & Analytics]
```

### Data Capture & Processing Pipeline

#### 1. Session Recording (Desktop App)
**Real-time CV Processing:**
- Ball position tracking using YOLO object detection
- Make/miss classification via ML models
- Timing analysis for streak detection
- Performance metric calculations

**Live Statistics Calculated:**
- Total putts attempted and makes/misses
- Make percentage with 2-decimal precision
- Best consecutive streak tracking
- Session duration in decimal seconds
- Performance rates (PPM/MPM - Putts/Makes Per Minute)
- Advanced metrics (Most makes in 60s, Fastest 21 consecutive)

#### 2. Session Data Object Structure
```javascript
{
  total_putts: 5,
  total_makes: 3,
  total_misses: 2,
  make_percentage: 60.0,
  best_streak: 3,
  session_duration_seconds: 6.5,
  putts_per_minute: 46.15,
  makes_per_minute: 27.69,
  most_makes_in_60_seconds: 3,
  fastest_21_makes: null,
  date_recorded: "2025-09-05T18:39:39.102Z"
}
```

#### 3. Upload & Authentication System
**Desktop Upload Mode:**
- Header: `x-desktop-upload: true`
- No JWT authentication required
- Direct session data transmission

**Web Upload Mode:**
- Header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- JWT validation with player ownership verification
- Secure session data handling

#### 4. Database Storage Architecture
**Sessions Table Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE sessions (
    session_id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,      -- UUID string
    player_id INTEGER NOT NULL,               -- Player reference
    data JSONB NOT NULL,                      -- Complete session data
    stats_summary JSONB,                      -- Extracted key metrics
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,     -- Upload timestamp
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE      -- Last modification
);
```

**Automated Player Stats Aggregation:**
```sql
-- Real-time stat updates on each session upload
UPDATE player_stats SET
  total_sessions = total_sessions + 1,
  total_putts = total_putts + NEW.total_putts,
  total_makes = total_makes + NEW.total_makes,
  best_streak = GREATEST(best_streak, NEW.best_streak),
  make_percentage = (total_makes / total_putts) * 100
```

#### 5. API Data Transformation
**Database → Frontend Field Mapping:**

| Database Field | API Response | Display Format |
|---|---|---|
| `data.total_putts` | `total_putts` | Integer |
| `data.total_makes` | `makes` | Integer |
| `data.best_streak` | `best_streak` | Integer |
| `data.session_duration_seconds` | `duration` | "MM:SS" |
| `data.putts_per_minute` | `ppm` | Decimal (2 places) |
| `data.most_makes_in_60_seconds` | `most_in_60s` | Integer |

**Duration Formatting Function:**
```javascript
function formatDuration(seconds) {
  const totalSeconds = Math.round(seconds);
  const minutes = Math.floor(totalSeconds / 60);
  const remainingSeconds = totalSeconds % 60;
  return `${minutes.toString().padStart(2, '0')}:${remainingSeconds.toString().padStart(2, '0')}`;
}
```

### Critical Technical Implementation Notes

#### Session ID Management
- **Format**: UUID v4 (`e95aa70c-c77d-4032-a024-c24db98f730e`)
- **Database Type**: VARCHAR(255) - NOT INTEGER
- **Uniqueness**: Primary key constraint with upsert pattern

#### Error Handling & Edge Cases
- **Zero-value sessions**: Allowed for practice/calibration
- **Missing data**: Default values prevent crashes
- **Database failures**: Graceful error responses with logging
- **CORS Configuration**: Wildcard origin for development

#### Production Readiness Checklist
- ✅ **UUID session IDs**: Proper VARCHAR(255) implementation
- ✅ **JSONB storage**: Efficient data and stats_summary columns
- ✅ **Authentication**: Dual-mode (desktop/web) handling
- ✅ **Data validation**: Comprehensive field verification
- ✅ **Performance optimization**: Strategic indexing and caching

- **✅ Leaderboard v2 Deployment**: Advanced ranking system with fallback queries when stored procedures unavailable
- **✅ API Routing Conflicts**: Resolved Vercel deployment conflicts between `/api/player/[id]/*` endpoints

### 🔧 Current Technical Issues

#### **Desktop Application**
- **Auto-upload Failures**: Missing `/api/upload-session` endpoint
  - **Status**: Needs implementation for CV session data upload
  - **Workaround**: Manual session data export available
  - **Priority**: Medium - desktop sessions work, just no auto-sync

#### **Web Application**
- **Form Accessibility Warnings**: Missing autocomplete attributes
  - **Solution**: Add `autoComplete` props to password inputs

  - **Impact**: Enhanced real-time competition experience
  - **Priority**: Future enhancement

### ⚖️ **Fair-Play Timer System - Technical Implementation**

**Critical Competitive Integrity Feature**: The fair-play timer ensures that timed sessions (duels and league rounds) start timing only when the first putt attempt is detected, giving players adequate time to move from their computer to the putting mat.

#### **Technical Implementation Details**
```python
# Fair-play timer logic in desktop/python/cv_tracker/run_tracker.py
session_start_time_local = None  # Starts as None, not immediate time.time()

# Timer starts only on first putt detection (mat → ramp transition)
if session_start_time_local is None and ball_in_ramp and putt_classifier.current_state.name == "PUTT_IN_PROGRESS":
    session_start_time_local = time.time()
    current_session_time = 0.0  # This is the moment timing begins
    logging.info("First putt detected in ramp. Session timer started.")
    logging.info("Fair-play timer ensures players have time to get from computer to putting mat.")
```

#### **Integration with Competitive Sessions**
- **Duels**: Timer starts on first putt, not session creation
- **League Rounds**: Time limits begin fairly when play actually starts  
- **Deep Link Integration**: Desktop receives session time limits via `proofofputt://start-session` URLs
- **Competitive Integrity**: Eliminates unfair advantage for players closer to their putting setup

#### **Ball Transition Detection**
- **ROI Tracking**: Monitors ball position across calibrated regions of interest
- **State Machine**: Uses `PuttClassifier` to detect `WAITING` → `PUTT_IN_PROGRESS` transitions
- **Mat to Ramp Detection**: Specifically tracks ball moving from `PUTTING_MAT_ROI` to `RAMP_ROI`
- **Prototype Consistency**: Matches original fair-play logic from early prototypes

### 🏥 Support & Resolution Priorities
1. **Critical (0-24h)**: Auth failures, data loss, security issues
2. **High (1-3 days)**: Competition features, user experience blockers  
3. **Medium (1-2 weeks)**: Performance optimization, accessibility
4. **Low (Future releases)**: Feature enhancements, nice-to-have improvements
