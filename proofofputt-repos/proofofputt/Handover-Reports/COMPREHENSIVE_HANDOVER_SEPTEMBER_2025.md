**Generated:** September 26, 2025
**Session Focus:** Critical Session Data Capture Fix & System Status
**Status:** Production Ready+ with Recent Critical Fixes

---

## Executive Summary

This report documents the current state of the Proof of Putt project following a critical session data capture fix that resolved a major competitive integrity issue. The platform is a sophisticated AI-powered golf putting training and competition system that combines computer vision tracking with web-based analytics and social competition features.

**System Status:** Production Ready+ with all core systems operational and recent critical bug fixes successfully implemented.

## Critical Breakthrough: Session Data Capture Fix (September 2025)

### 🎯 **The Core Problem**
Competitive sessions (duels/leagues) were showing 0-0 scores instead of actual putt data, despite the tracker window correctly displaying real-time counts. This was a critical competitive integrity issue affecting the entire competition system.

### 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**
The issue was discovered in the session finalization process during force termination:

**Problem:** When sessions were terminated by timer expiry (common in competitive duels), the signal handler (`run_tracker.py:35-40`) couldn't access the real-time counters (`total_makes`, `total_misses`) because they were local variables in the main loop.

**Evidence:**
- Tracker window showed correct counts: "1 make, 4 misses"
- Sessions finalized with: "No session data to stage"
- Database entries showed 0-0 scores instead of actual performance

### ✅ **The Solution**
Implemented synchronization of local variables to global session state on every putt classification:

```python
# run_tracker.py:768-773 - Critical session stats synchronization
# Update global session stats for signal handler
session_stats['makes'] = total_makes
session_stats['misses'] = total_misses
session_stats['total_putts'] = total_makes + total_misses
session_stats['consecutive_makes'] = consecutive_makes
session_stats['max_consecutive_makes'] = max_consecutive_makes
```

**Debug logging added:**
```python
# run_tracker.py:37-38 - Signal handler verification
logging.info(f"[SIGNAL DEBUG] Session stats available: makes={session_stats_global.get('makes', 'missing')}, misses={session_stats_global.get('misses', 'missing')}")
```

### 📈 **Impact & Results**
- **Before Fix:** Sessions showed 0-0 scores, competitive integrity compromised
- **After Fix:** Sessions capture real data (e.g., "6 makes out of 8 putts") correctly
- **Validation:** User testing confirmed successful data capture during timer expiry scenarios
- **Competition System:** Duels and leagues now display actual performance data

## Enhanced Competition System (September 2025)

### 🏆 **API & Database Improvements**

#### Enhanced Duel Scoring (`app/api/duels.js`)
**Problem:** Score calculation logic only worked for active duels, showing 0-0 for completed duels.

**Solution:** Extended scoring logic to work for ALL duel statuses:
```javascript
// Lines 151-168: Always calculate from session data when available
if (duel.creator_session_data) {
  // Use stored score if available and not null/0, otherwise calculate from session data
  if (calculatedCreatorScore === null || calculatedCreatorScore === 0) {
    calculatedCreatorScore = duel.creator_session_data.total_makes || 0;
  }
}
```

#### Competition Context Integration (`app/api/sessions.js`)
**Enhancement:** Added complex JOIN queries to include duel and league information in session history:
```sql
-- Lines 43-81: Complex JOIN query for competition context
LEFT JOIN duels d ON (s.session_id = d.duel_creator_session_id OR s.session_id = d.duel_invited_player_session_id)
LEFT JOIN players creator ON d.duel_creator_id = creator.player_id
LEFT JOIN players invited_player ON d.duel_invited_player_id = invited_player.player_id
LEFT JOIN league_round_sessions lrs ON s.session_id = lrs.session_id
```

### 🎨 **Frontend Integration**

#### Session History Enhancement (`app/src/components/SessionHistoryPage.jsx`)
- Added "Competition" column to session history table (line 128)
- Updated table structure to accommodate competition context

#### Competition Badges (`app/src/components/SessionRow.jsx`)
Visual indicators for competition context:
```javascript
// Lines 177-189: Competition badge display
{session.competition ? (
  session.competition.type === 'duel' ? (
    <span className="competition-badge duel-badge" title={`Duel vs ${session.competition.opponent_name}`}>
      🥊 vs {session.competition.opponent_name}
    </span>
  ) : (
    <span className="competition-badge league-badge" title={`${session.competition.league_name} Round ${session.competition.round_number}`}>
      🏟️ {session.competition.league_name}
    </span>
  )
) : '—'}
```

#### Debug Logging (`app/src/components/DuelsPage.jsx`)
Enhanced debugging for score display issues:
```javascript
// Lines 128-140: Debug logging for score display
if (duel.status === 'completed' && (yourScore === 0 && opponentScore === 0)) {
  console.log(`[DuelRow] Potential score display issue for duel ${duel.duel_id}:`, {
    status: duel.status,
    isCreator,
    rawCreatorScore: duel.creator_score,
    rawInvitedScore: duel.invited_player_score
  });
}
```
