# Desktop App API Connection Fix - Handover Report
**Date:** October 9, 2025
**Status:** Primary Issue Resolved, Cross-Platform Builds Planned But Not Started

---

## Executive Summary

The desktop application was experiencing critical failures when starting duel sessions. The root cause was identified as a hardcoded localhost API URL in the Rust backend that prevented the production app from connecting to the live server at `https://app.proofofputt.com/api`. This issue has been successfully resolved.

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ API connection issue fixed
- ‚úÖ Duel sessions now working in production
- ‚úÖ Updated DMG deployed to website (v0.1.1 aarch64)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cross-platform builds planned but NOT yet started
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Background build processes may still be running from previous session

---

## Problem Description

### Initial Symptoms
User reported that duel sessions were not starting, with the app reloading quickly after failure. Error messages showed:

```
üü¢ ‚ùå Auto-upload failed: error sending request for url
(http://127.0.0.1:5001/upload-session): error trying to connect:
tcp connect error: Connection refused (os error 61)
```

Additional symptoms:
- App appeared to show "Tracker Error" messages
- Sessions would fail immediately after start
- Auto-upload functionality completely broken

### Root Cause

The desktop app's Rust backend (`session_manager.rs`) had a hardcoded fallback URL pointing to localhost instead of the production server:

**File:** `desktop/src-tauri/src/session_manager.rs` (line 63)

**Before (Broken):**
```rust
pub fn new() -> Self {
    // Use VITE_API_URL to be consistent with the frontend, falling back to localhost for safety.
    let api_base_url = std::env::var("VITE_API_URL")
        .unwrap_or_else(|_| "http://127.0.0.1:5001".to_string());
```

**After (Fixed):**
```rust
pub fn new() -> Self {
    // Use VITE_API_URL to be consistent with the frontend, falling back to production server
    let api_base_url = std::env::var("VITE_API_URL")
        .unwrap_or_else(|_| "https://app.proofofputt.com/api".to_string());
```

### Why This Happened

The `.env` file contains `VITE_API_URL=https://app.proofofputt.com/api`, but environment variables are NOT read at runtime in production Tauri builds. The app was falling back to the hardcoded localhost URL, which had no server running, causing all API calls to fail with "Connection refused."

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Code Fix
- Modified `desktop/src-tauri/src/session_manager.rs` line 63
- Changed fallback URL from `http://127.0.0.1:5001` to `https://app.proofofputt.com/api`
- Committed to git: "Fix production API URL in session manager"

### 2. Rebuild Production App
```bash
cd /Users/nw/proofofputt-repos/proofofputt/desktop
npm run tauri build
```

**Build Details:**
- Target: aarch64-apple-darwin (Apple Silicon only)
- Compile time: 10.47s
- Output: `ProofOfPutt-0.1.1-aarch64.dmg`
- File size: 11M (increased from 5.5M)
- Signing: Developer ID Application: Nicholas Kirwan (88AT895868)
- Notarization: Apple notarized ‚úÖ

### 3. Install Updated App
```bash
open src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/Proof\ of\ Putt.app
```

### 4. Testing Result
User confirmed: **"Terrific, this is now working!"**

### 5. Website Deployment
Copied new DMG to website:
```bash
cp src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/ProofOfPutt-0.1.1-aarch64.dmg \
   ../proofofputt-website/public/
```

Committed and pushed to website repository.

---

## Outstanding Issues

### 1. Background Build Processes
**CRITICAL:** Two background build processes may still be running from the previous session:

```
Background Bash dedadb:
  cd /Users/nw/proofofputt-repos/proofofputt/desktop &&
  npm run tauri build -- --target universal-apple-darwin

Background Bash 976b06:
  npm run tauri build
```

**Action Required:**
- Check if these processes are still running: `/bashes` command
- Kill if necessary to avoid conflicts
- Verify no corrupt build artifacts remain

### 2. Universal Binary Build Failed Previously
During the conversation, an attempt to build a universal binary failed because the x86_64 target was not installed:

```
Error: Target x86_64-apple-darwin is not installed
```

**What Was Attempted:**
```bash
npm run tauri build -- --target universal-apple-darwin
```

**What's Needed:**
```bash
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin
npm run tauri build -- --target universal-apple-darwin
```

**Status:** This was attempted but the user interrupted, indicating other issues need to be resolved first.

### 3. Cross-Platform Build Requirements

A comprehensive plan was created and approved by the user, but **NONE of these builds have been started yet:**

#### Phase 1: Windows Build (Estimated 3-4 hours)
**Prerequisites:**
- Windows machine or VM with Rust toolchain
- Visual Studio Build Tools
- Python 3.11+ for Windows
- Camera backend: CAP_DSHOW (DirectShow)

**Commands:**
```bash
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
npm run tauri build -- --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

**Expected Output:** `.msi` installer (~15-20MB)

#### Phase 2: Linux Build (Estimated 2-3 hours)
**Prerequisites:**
- Linux machine or VM (Ubuntu 22.04+ recommended)
- Rust toolchain
- System dependencies: `libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev`, `build-essential`, `libssl-dev`, `libgtk-3-dev`, `libayatana-appindicator3-dev`, `librsvg2-dev`
- Python 3.11+
- Camera backend: CAP_V4L2 (Video4Linux2)

**Commands:**
```bash
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
npm run tauri build -- --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

**Expected Output:** AppImage or `.deb` (~18-25MB)

#### Phase 3: macOS Builds
**Universal Binary:**
- Requires x86_64 target installation
- Estimated 1 hour
- Expected size: ~18-22MB

**Intel-only Binary:**
- Alternative to universal
- Smaller file size
- Easier to build

#### Phase 4: Download Page Updates
**File:** `proofofputt-website/src/app/download/page.tsx`

**Needs:**
- OS detection logic
- Multiple download buttons
- Platform-specific installation instructions
- File size and version information
- Analytics tracking for each platform

## Troubleshooting Notes

### If Connection Issues Return

1. **Check API URL in code:**
   ```bash
   grep -n "api_base_url" desktop/src-tauri/src/session_manager.rs
   ```
   Should show fallback to `https://app.proofofputt.com/api`

2. **Verify production server is reachable:**
   ```bash
   curl -I https://app.proofofputt.com/api/upload-session
   ```

3. **Check if localhost server is accidentally running:**
   ```bash
   lsof -i :5001
   ```

4. **Rebuild and reinstall app:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/nw/proofofputt-repos/proofofputt/desktop
   npm run tauri build
   open src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/Proof\ of\ Putt.app
   ```

### Tracker Error Messages

If you see "Tracker Error" messages, check:
1. Actual tracker logs (may be truncated in UI)
2. API connection status (most common issue)
3. Camera permissions
4. Python dependencies

The "Tracker Error" seen initially was actually a truncated message hiding the real API connection error.
