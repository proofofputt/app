## üîß FINAL STEP: Configure Webhook in Zaprite Dashboard

### Step 1: Log in to Zaprite
Go to: https://app.zaprite.com

### Step 2: Navigate to Webhooks
- Click **Settings** (gear icon) or **Developers**
- Select **Webhooks** from the menu
- Click **Add Webhook** or **Create Endpoint**

### Step 3: Configure Webhook URL

**Webhook Endpoint URL:**
```
https://app.proofofputt.com/api/webhooks/zaprite-subscription
```

### Step 4: Subscribe to Events

Select these event types (check all that apply):

- ‚úÖ `payment.succeeded` - Customer payment completed successfully
- ‚úÖ `subscription.created` - New subscription started
- ‚úÖ `subscription.canceled` (or `subscription.cancelled`) - Subscription cancelled
- ‚úÖ `subscription.renewed` - Subscription renewed for another period
- ‚úÖ `payment.failed` - Payment attempt failed
- ‚úÖ `order.paid` - Order payment completed (if available)

**Note**: Event names may vary slightly in Zaprite dashboard. Select all payment and subscription-related events.

### Step 5: Save Webhook

- Click **Save** or **Create Webhook**
- **Important**: Zaprite does NOT require a webhook signing secret (this is normal)

### Step 6: Test Webhook (Optional but Recommended)

If Zaprite provides a "Test Webhook" button:
1. Click **Test Webhook** or **Send Test Event**
2. You should see: `200 OK` response
3. Response body: `{"success":true,"message":"Event received but not processed"}`

## üìä DATABASE VERIFICATION

Your database is ready with:

### Tables Created:
- ‚úÖ `zaprite_payment_events` - Webhook event log
- ‚úÖ `subscription_bundles` - Bundle pricing
- ‚úÖ `user_gift_subscriptions` - Gift codes

### Subscription Bundles:
| Bundle | Quantity | Discount | Price Each |

| 3-Pack | 3 years | 10% | $18.90 |
| 5-Pack | 5 years | 20% | $16.80 |

## üéØ WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A PAYMENT IS MADE

### User Flow:
1. User clicks "Subscribe Monthly" ($2.10) or "Subscribe Annually" ($21)
2. Frontend calls: `POST /api/subscriptions/create-zaprite-order`
3. API creates Zaprite order and returns `checkoutUrl`
4. User redirected to Zaprite payment page
5. User completes payment (Bitcoin/Lightning/Card)
6. **Zaprite sends webhook** ‚Üí `POST /api/webhooks/zaprite-subscription`
7. Webhook handler updates database:
   ```sql
   UPDATE players SET
     is_subscribed = TRUE,
     subscription_expires_at = NOW() + INTERVAL '1 year',
     subscription_tier = 'Full Subscriber',
     zaprite_customer_id = '<customer_id>',
     zaprite_payment_method = 'lightning'
   WHERE id = <user_id>;
   ```
8. If annual subscription: Generate gift code ‚Üí `user_gift_subscriptions` table
9. User redirected to success page

### Webhook Events Handled:
| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `payment.succeeded` | Activate subscription, generate gift if annual |
| `subscription.created` | Log subscription start |
| `subscription.canceled` | Set status to 'canceled' |
| `payment.failed` | Set status to 'past_due', log error |

### Test Checklist:

## üÜò TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Webhook not receiving events
**Solution**:
1. Verify webhook URL in Zaprite dashboard is correct
2. Check webhook endpoint is publicly accessible: `curl https://app.proofofputt.com/api/webhooks/zaprite-subscription`
3. Check Zaprite dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí View Delivery Logs

### Issue: Payment succeeds but subscription not activated
**Solution**:
1. Check Vercel logs: `vercel logs --filter="zaprite"`
2. Check `zaprite_payment_events` table for errors
3. Manually activate if needed:
   ```sql
   UPDATE players
   SET is_subscribed = TRUE,
       subscription_expires_at = NOW() + INTERVAL '1 year',
       subscription_tier = 'Full Subscriber'
   WHERE id = <user_id>;
   ```

### Issue: Gift code not generated for annual subscription
**Solution**:
```sql
-- Manually generate gift code
INSERT INTO user_gift_subscriptions (owner_user_id, gift_code, is_redeemed)
VALUES (<user_id>, CONCAT('GIFT-', UPPER(SUBSTRING(MD5(RANDOM()::text), 1, 16))), FALSE);
```
