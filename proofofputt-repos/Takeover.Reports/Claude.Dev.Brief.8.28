 Your task is to review the entire project codebase to create an up to date 
  briefing and technical report for getting developers up to speed with the 
  platform.  Review all handover reports, starting with the newest first.  
  Then compare the prototype directory to the active files in desktop, 
  backend, and frontend directories.  We will be initiating new repositories 
  per the /Users/nw/proofofputt/Handover Reports/Launch Strategy: Desktop 
  Application Rel.md

⏺ I'll review the entire project codebase to create an up-to-date briefing
  and technical report. Let me start by examining the project structure and
  then review the handover reports, beginning with the newest first.

⏺ List(~/proofofputt)
  ⎿  Listed 370 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now let me examine the Handover Reports directory to identify the newest reports
  first:

⏺ Bash(ls -la "/Users/nw/proofofputt/Handover Reports/" | head -20)
  ⎿  total 776

  Proof of Putt Platform Technical Briefing & Developer Handover Report

  Date: August 28, 2025Version: 1.0Prepared for: New Developer Onboarding

  ---
  Executive Summary

  Proof of Putt is a comprehensive golf putting analysis platform that combines computer
   vision, web applications, and desktop software to track, analyze, and gamify putting
  performance. The platform consists of three main components: a Python backend for
  AI-powered putt classification, a React web application for social features and data
  visualization, and a Tauri desktop application for local video processing.

  Current Status: The platform has undergone significant stabilization and feature
  restoration as of August 28, 2025, with UI recovery complete and core functionalities
  operational. The system is now ready for deployment restructuring per the launch
  strategy.

  Repository Restructuring Plan

  Per the Launch Strategy: Desktop Application Release document, the current monorepo
  structure will be split into three repositories:

  Planned Repository Structure

  1. proofofputt-backend - Python Flask API and services
  2. proofofputt-frontend - React web application
  3. proofofputt-desktop - Tauri desktop application

  Deployment Strategy

  - Backend: Deploy to Vercel with NeonDB and SendGrid integration
  - Frontend: Deploy to Vercel with environment variable configuration
  - Desktop: Build and distribute via GitHub Releases (macOS .dmg, Windows .msi)
