## ü•ä DUELS SYSTEM - COMPLETE TEST REQUIREMENTS

### DUEL LIFECYCLE TESTING

#### 1. DUEL CREATION TEST
**Priority: CRITICAL - Must Pass Before Launch**

```bash
# Test via API
curl -X POST https://app.proofofputt.com/api/create-duel \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "invited_player_id": 2,
    "time_limit_minutes": 2,
    "putting_distance_feet": 7,
    "invite_type": "existing_player"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "duel": {
    "duel_id": 123,
    "status": "pending",
    "expires_at": "2025-09-30T12:00:00Z",
    "parameters": "duel=123,time_limit=120,scoring=total_makes"
  }
}
```

**Pass Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Duel ID generated
- ‚úÖ Status = "pending"
- ‚úÖ Expiry time set correctly (default 72 hours)
- ‚úÖ Parameters string generated for desktop app
- ‚úÖ Notification sent to invited player

#### 2. DUEL ACCEPTANCE TEST
**Priority: CRITICAL**

```bash
# Accept duel via API
curl -X POST https://app.proofofputt.com/api/respond-duel \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "duel_id": 123,
    "response": "accepted"
  }'
```

**Expected Flow:**
1. Invited player receives notification
2. Click "Accept" on web interface
3. Duel status changes to "active"
4. Both players can now submit sessions
5. Timer countdown begins

**Pass Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Status changes from "pending" to "active"
- ‚úÖ Both players see duel in "Active Competitions"
- ‚úÖ Parameters available for desktop session
- ‚úÖ Expiry timer visible and counting down

#### 3. DESKTOP SESSION EXECUTION TEST
**Priority: CRITICAL - Camera Fix Verification**

**Step-by-Step Process:**
```
1. COPY PARAMETERS from web interface
   Example: "duel=123,time_limit=120,scoring=total_makes"

2. LAUNCH DESKTOP APP
   - Login with player credentials
   - Navigate to "Parameter Input" section
   - Paste parameters string

3. START SESSION
   - Verify camera index = 1 (NOT 0)
   - Confirm YOLO detection active
   - Check fair-play timer ready (shows "Ready: 02:00")

4. EXECUTE PUTTS
   - Place ball on mat
   - Execute first putt (mat ‚Üí ramp transition)
   - VERIFY: Timer starts ONLY on first putt
   - Continue putting for session duration

5. SESSION COMPLETION
   - Timer expires OR press 'Q' to end
   - Session data stages for upload
   - Auto-upload initiates
```

**Critical Validation Points:**
```python
# Check logs for these REQUIRED messages:
"[RAMP DEBUG] Ball detected on ramp"  # Ball detection working
"[DUEL TIMER DEBUG] state='Active', timer_started=True"  # Timer active
"[SESSION] Staging session data for upload"  # Data capture
"[SESSION] Makes: X, Misses: Y"  # Actual scores (NOT 0-0)
```

#### 4. SCORE SUBMISSION TEST
**Priority: CRITICAL**

**Automated Submission Flow:**
```
Session End ‚Üí Data Staging ‚Üí Upload ‚Üí API Processing ‚Üí Database Storage ‚Üí Score Update
```

**Manual Verification:**
```bash
# Check duel status after session
curl https://app.proofofputt.com/api/duels?player_id=1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" | jq '.duels[] | select(.duel_id==123)'
```

**Expected Data:**
```json
{
  "duel_id": 123,
  "status": "active",
  "creator_score": 6,  // MUST NOT BE 0
  "invited_player_score": 0,  // Waiting for opponent
  "creator_session_data": {
    "total_makes": 6,
    "total_misses": 2,
    "make_percentage": 75.0
  }
}
```

**FAILURE INDICATORS:**
- ‚ùå Scores showing 0-0 after session
- ‚ùå session_data is null
- ‚ùå "No session data to stage" error
- ‚ùå Session not linked to duel

#### 5. DUEL COMPLETION TEST
**Priority: CRITICAL**

**Both Players Complete Sessions:**
1. Player 1 submits score: 6 makes
2. Player 2 submits score: 8 makes
3. System determines winner
4. Duel status changes to "completed"

**Winner Determination Logic:**
```javascript
// Scoring logic verification
if (scoring_type === "total_makes") {
  winner = player1.makes > player2.makes ? player1 : player2;
} else if (scoring_type === "make_percentage") {
  winner = player1.percentage > player2.percentage ? player1 : player2;
}
```

**Pass Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Status = "completed"
- ‚úÖ Winner ID correctly assigned
- ‚úÖ Both scores visible and accurate
- ‚úÖ Notifications sent to both players
- ‚úÖ Duel moves to "Completed" section

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Championship",
    "max_players": 8,
    "rounds": 3,

2. **Join Code:** Players enter league code
3. **Public Browse:** Find in public leagues list

**Validation:**
```bash
# Check league membership
curl https://app.proofofputt.com/api/leagues/123/members
```

**Expected:**

- Member count accurate
- Player rankings initialized

#### 3. ROUND MANAGEMENT TEST
**Priority: CRITICAL**

**Round Lifecycle:**
```
1. ROUND SCHEDULING
   - Start time: Immediate or scheduled
   - Duration: Time limit per round
   - Auto-advance: Next round after completion

2. ROUND PARTICIPATION
   - Players notified of round start
   - Desktop parameters generated
   - Sessions linked to round

3. ROUND SCORING
   - Real-time leaderboard updates
   - Points calculation (1st = N points, 2nd = N-1, etc.)
   - Tiebreaker logic applied
```

**Critical Test Scenario:**
```python
# Simulate 4-player round
Player A: 12 makes in 5 minutes ‚Üí 4 points
Player B: 10 makes in 5 minutes ‚Üí 3 points
Player C: 10 makes in 5 minutes ‚Üí 2 points (tiebreaker)
Player D: 8 makes in 5 minutes ‚Üí 1 point
```

#### 4. IRL MODE TEST
**Priority: HIGH (Special Feature)**

**IRL (In Real Life) Mode Requirements:**
```javascript
// IRL Mode Logic
if (league.is_irl) {
  // Create temporary players
  for (let i = 1; i <= player_count; i++) {
    create_temp_player(`Player ${i}`, `temp_player_${i}@irl.local`);
  }
  // Sessions DO NOT affect personal stats
  isolate_session_data = true;
}
```

**Test Process:**
1. Create league with `is_irl: true`
2. Enter 4 player names
3. Start round with temporary players
4. Complete sessions
5. Verify personal stats unchanged

**Pass Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Temporary players created
- ‚úÖ Names persist in localStorage
- ‚úÖ Sessions isolated from stats
- ‚úÖ League scoring works normally
- ‚úÖ No login required for temp players

#### 5. TOURNAMENT COMPLETION TEST
**Priority: CRITICAL**

**Multi-Round Tournament:**
```
Round 1: All players participate
Round 2: All players participate
Round 3: Final round
Calculate: Total points across all rounds
Determine: Tournament winner
```

**Final Verification:**
```bash
# Check tournament results
curl https://app.proofofputt.com/api/leagues/123/final-results
```

**Expected Outcome:**
- Final rankings displayed
- Total points calculated
- Winner declared
- Tournament marked complete
- Historical data preserved

## üîç CRITICAL FAILURE POINTS & SOLUTIONS

### HIGH-RISK FAILURE SCENARIOS

#### 1. CAMERA INDEX FAILURE
**Problem:** Camera 0 doesn't capture frames
**Impact:** 0-0 scores, no ball detection
**Solution:** Default camera index = 1
**Verification:**
```python
# In App.jsx line 21
const [cameraIndex, setCameraIndex] = useState(1); // MUST BE 1, NOT 0
```

#### 2. SESSION DATA SYNCHRONIZATION
**Problem:** Local variables not accessible to signal handler
**Impact:** "No session data to stage" error
**Solution:** Global state synchronization
**Verification:**
```python
# In run_tracker.py lines 768-773
session_stats['makes'] = total_makes  # MUST sync on every putt
session_stats['misses'] = total_misses
```

#### 3. FAIR-PLAY TIMER FAILURE
**Problem:** Timer starts immediately
**Impact:** Unfair advantage/disadvantage
**Solution:** Start on first putt only
**Verification:**
```python
# Timer should show "Ready: XX:XX" until first putt
# Then transition to "Active: XX:XX" countdown
```

#### 4. API SCORE CALCULATION
**Problem:** Scores only calculate for active duels
**Impact:** Completed duels show 0-0
**Solution:** Calculate for ALL statuses
**Verification:**
```javascript
// In api/duels.js
if (duel.creator_session_data) {  // Works for any status
  calculatedCreatorScore = duel.creator_session_data.total_makes || 0;
}
```

## üéØ FINAL MISSION-CRITICAL SUMMARY

**DUELS & LEAGUES ARE THE HEART OF PROOF OF PUTT**

These systems MUST work perfectly for launch success. Any failure in competitive features will result in immediate user churn and platform failure.

**TOP 3 CRITICAL VERIFICATIONS:**
1. ‚úÖ **Camera Index = 1** (Prevents 0-0 scores)
2. ‚úÖ **Fair-Play Timer** (Starts on first putt only)
3. ‚úÖ **Session Data Upload** (Links to competitions)

**LAUNCH CONFIDENCE: HIGH** - With proper testing and monitoring, the competition systems are robust and ready for production use.
