revoked_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active'  -- 'active' | 'revoked'
notes TEXT
UNIQUE(student_player_id, coach_player_id)
```

**Indexes:**
- `idx_coach_access_student` ON (student_player_id, status)
- `idx_coach_access_coach` ON (coach_player_id, status)

#### `friendships`
```sql
friendship_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
player_id INTEGER REFERENCES players(player_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
friend_id INTEGER REFERENCES players(player_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'accepted'  -- 'pending' | 'accepted' | 'blocked'
created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()

**Indexes:**
- `idx_friendships_player` ON (player_id, status)
- `idx_friendships_friend` ON (friend_id, status)
- `idx_friendships_both` ON (player_id, friend_id)

### Modified Tables

#### `players`
**New Columns:**

## 🧪 Comprehensive Testing Plan

### Priority Levels
- **P0 (Critical)**: Must pass before production release
- **P1 (High)**: Should pass, core functionality
- **P2 (Medium)**: Important but not blocking
- **P3 (Low)**: Nice to have, edge cases

---

### Section 1: Database Layer Testing

#### Test 1.1: Referral Chain Population (P0)
**Objective**: Verify 5-level referral chain populates correctly

**Pre-requisites:**
- 5 test players created with referral relationships: P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → P5

**Test Steps:**
```sql
-- Create test players
INSERT INTO players (name, email, referred_by_player_id)
VALUES ('Player 1', 'p1@test.com', NULL);  -- Returns player_id 1

INSERT INTO players (name, email, referred_by_player_id)
VALUES ('Player 2', 'p2@test.com', 1);  -- Should auto-populate referrer_level_1 = 1

INSERT INTO players (name, email, referred_by_player_id)
VALUES ('Player 3', 'p3@test.com', 2);  -- Should auto-populate referrer_level_1 = 2, referrer_level_2 = 1

-- Verify chain
SELECT player_id, name, referrer_level_1, referrer_level_2, referrer_level_3
FROM players WHERE player_id IN (1,2,3,4,5);
```

**Expected Result:**
- P2: referrer_level_1 = P1
- P3: referrer_level_1 = P2, referrer_level_2 = P1
- P4: referrer_level_1 = P3, referrer_level_2 = P2, referrer_level_3 = P1
- P5: All 4 levels populated + referrer_level_5 = NULL

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Trigger fires on INSERT
- ✅ All referrer levels populated correctly
- ✅ Chain stops at 5 levels (no level_6)

---

#### Test 1.2: Auto-Friend Trigger (P0)
**Objective**: Verify bidirectional friendship created on referral signup

**Test Steps:**
```sql
-- Create referrer
INSERT INTO players (name, email, referral_code)
VALUES ('Coach Mike', 'coach@test.com', 'COACH123')
RETURNING player_id;  -- Returns 100

-- Create referred player
INSERT INTO players (name, email, referred_by_player_id)
VALUES ('Student Alice', 'alice@test.com', 100);  -- Returns 101

-- Verify bidirectional friendship
SELECT * FROM friendships
WHERE (player_id = 100 AND friend_id = 101)
   OR (player_id = 101 AND friend_id = 100);
```

**Expected Result:**
```
friendship_id | player_id | friend_id | status   | source    | created_at
1             | 101       | 100       | accepted | referral  | 2025-10-18...
2             | 100       | 101       | accepted | referral  | 2025-10-18...
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Two friendships created (bidirectional)
- ✅ Both have status = 'accepted'
- ✅ Both have source = 'referral'
- ✅ source_context contains referral_code and auto_created = true

---

#### Test 1.3: Coach Access Grant Constraints (P1)
**Objective**: Verify database constraints prevent invalid grants

**Test Steps:**
```sql
-- Test 1: Duplicate grant prevention
INSERT INTO coach_access_grants (student_player_id, coach_player_id)
VALUES (101, 100);

INSERT INTO coach_access_grants (student_player_id, coach_player_id)
VALUES (101, 100);  -- Should FAIL with UNIQUE constraint violation

-- Test 2: Self-granting (application logic, not DB constraint)
-- This is prevented at API level, not database level
```

**Expected Result:**
- First INSERT succeeds
- Second INSERT fails with `duplicate key value violates unique constraint`

---

2. Player A grants Player B coach access
3. Player B grants Player A coach access
4. Player A navigates to `/contacts`
   - Verify Player B shows:
     - "✓ Coach Access: ON (you granted them access)"
     - "✓ They granted you access"
     - "View Their Sessions" button visible
5. Player A views Player B's sessions
6. Player B views Player A's sessions
7. Player A revokes Player B's access
8. Player B can no longer view Player A's sessions
9. Player A can still view Player B's sessions (B hasn't revoked A's access)

---

### Section 5: Performance Testing

#### Test 5.1: Large Friends List Performance (P2)

**Scenario**: User with 100+ friends

**Steps:**
1. Create test user with 100 friendships (with coach access status varied)

3. Measure page load time
4. Verify UI remains responsive

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Page loads in < 2 seconds
- ✅ No UI lag when scrolling
- ✅ API response time < 500ms

**API Query Optimization Check:**
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT /* friends query */
FROM friendships f
INNER JOIN players p ON f.friend_id = p.player_id
LEFT JOIN coach_access_grants cag1 ON ...
WHERE f.player_id = 101 AND f.status = 'accepted'
ORDER BY (CASE WHEN ... THEN 0 ELSE 1 END), f.created_at DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Expected**: Query uses indexes, no sequential scans

---

#### Test 5.2: Coach with Many Students (P2)

**Scenario**: Coach with 50+ students

4. Test filtering/sorting performance

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Dashboard loads in < 2 seconds
- ✅ Filtering/sorting instant (< 100ms)
- ✅ API response time < 500ms

---

### Section 6: Security Testing

#### Test 6.1: Authorization Bypass Attempts (P0)

**Test Case 6.1.1: JWT Token Manipulation**
- Attempt to view another user's sessions with modified token
- Expected: 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden

**Test Case 6.1.2: Direct Session Access Without Grant**
- User A has no coach grant from User B
- User A attempts: GET `/api/player/{user_b_id}/sessions`
- Expected: 403 Forbidden

**Test Case 6.1.3: Expired Coach Grant**
- Student grants coach access
- Student revokes access (status = 'revoked', revoked_at set)
- Coach attempts to view sessions
- Expected: 403 Forbidden (grant must have status = 'active')

---

#### Test 6.2: SQL Injection Prevention (P1)

**Test Case**: Malicious input in API endpoints

**Steps:**
1. Attempt SQL injection in coach_player_id:
   ```javascript
   POST /api/coach-access/grant
   Body: { "coach_player_id": "1; DROP TABLE players;--" }
   ```
2. Verify: Parameterized queries prevent injection
3. Expected: 400 Bad Request (invalid player_id format)

---

#### Test 6.3: XSS Prevention (P1)

**Test Case**: Malicious HTML/JavaScript in notes field

**Steps:**
1. Grant coach access with XSS payload:
   ```javascript
   POST /api/coach-access/grant
   Body: {
     "coach_player_id": 100,
     "notes": "<script>alert('XSS')</script>"
   }
   ```
2. View student in Coach Dashboard
3. Verify: Script not executed, displayed as plain text

---

### Section 7: Edge Cases & Error Handling

#### Test 7.1: Orphaned Coach Grants (P2)

**Scenario**: Coach grant exists but friendship deleted

**Steps:**
1. Create friendship between A and B
2. A grants B coach access
3. Manually delete friendship (not via API):
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM friendships WHERE player_id = A AND friend_id = B;
   ```
4. B attempts to view A's sessions
5. Expected behavior: ??? (Should we add trigger to auto-revoke?)

**Recommendation**: Add trigger to auto-revoke coach grants when friendship deleted:
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER revoke_coach_on_friendship_delete
AFTER DELETE ON friendships
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION auto_revoke_coach_access();
```

---

#### Test 7.2: Concurrent Grant/Revoke Operations (P3)

**Scenario**: Student grants and revokes access rapidly

**Steps:**
1. Rapidly toggle coach access on/off (10 times in 5 seconds)
2. Verify: Final state is consistent
3. Verify: No duplicate grants created
4. Check database:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM coach_access_grants
   WHERE student_player_id = X AND coach_player_id = Y;
   ```
   - Expected: 1 row (UNIQUE constraint prevents duplicates)

---

#### Test 7.3: Deleted Players (P2)

**Scenario**: Player granted coach access, then deleted account

**Steps:**
1. Student grants coach access
2. Student deletes account (player record deleted)
3. Coach navigates to `/coach/dashboard`
4. Verify: Student no longer appears (CASCADE delete should remove grant)

**Database Check:**
```sql
-- Verify CASCADE delete
SELECT * FROM coach_access_grants WHERE student_player_id = <deleted_player_id>;
-- Expected: 0 rows
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue 1: Auto-Friend Trigger Not Firing

**Symptoms:**
- New user signs up with referral code
- No friendships created in database

**Diagnosis:**
```sql
-- Check if trigger exists
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'trigger_auto_friend_referrer';

-- Check trigger function
\df auto_friend_referrer
```

**Possible Causes:**
1. Trigger not created (migration failed)
2. Trigger disabled
3. Error in trigger function (check logs)

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Re-run migration
\i database/add_friendships_and_contacts_system.sql

-- Or manually create trigger
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_auto_friend_referrer
AFTER INSERT ON players
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN (NEW.referred_by_player_id IS NOT NULL)
EXECUTE FUNCTION auto_friend_referrer();
```

---

### Issue 2: Coach Can't View Student Sessions (403 Error)

**Symptoms:**
- Coach granted access by student
- GET `/api/player/{student_id}/sessions` returns 403

**Diagnosis:**
```sql
-- Check if grant exists and is active
SELECT * FROM coach_access_grants
WHERE student_player_id = {student_id}
  AND coach_player_id = {coach_id}
  AND status = 'active';
```

**Possible Causes:**
1. Grant doesn't exist (toggle failed)
2. Grant status = 'revoked'
3. JWT token issue (wrong player_id in token)
4. Friendship doesn't exist (toggle requires friendship)

**Solution:**
```sql
-- If grant doesn't exist, create it
INSERT INTO coach_access_grants (student_player_id, coach_player_id, status)
VALUES ({student_id}, {coach_id}, 'active');

-- If grant is revoked, reactivate it
UPDATE coach_access_grants
SET status = 'active', revoked_at = NULL
WHERE student_player_id = {student_id}
  AND coach_player_id = {coach_id};
```

---

### Issue 3: Referrer Not Appearing First in Friends List

**Symptoms:**
- Friends list shows referrer, but not in first position

**Diagnosis:**
- Check API response from `/api/contacts/friends`
- Verify `is_referrer` flag is true

**Cause:**
- Query ORDER BY clause not prioritizing referrer

**Solution:**
```javascript
// In /api/contacts/friends.js
query += `
  ORDER BY
    (CASE WHEN current_player.referred_by_player_id = f.friend_id THEN 0 ELSE 1 END),
    f.created_at DESC
`;
```

---

### Issue 4: Duplicate Coach Grants Error

**Symptoms:**
- Toggling coach access fails with "duplicate key" error

**Diagnosis:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM coach_access_grants
WHERE student_player_id = X AND coach_player_id = Y;
```

**Cause:**
- Multiple active grants for same student-coach pair

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Delete duplicates, keep only the latest
DELETE FROM coach_access_grants
WHERE grant_id NOT IN (
  SELECT MAX(grant_id)
  FROM coach_access_grants
  GROUP BY student_player_id, coach_player_id
);
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

#### Adoption Metrics
- **Coach Adoption Rate**: `(Users with students) / (Total users)` × 100
- **Student Adoption Rate**: `(Users who granted access) / (Total users)` × 100
- **Active Grants**: Count of `coach_access_grants` where `status = 'active'`
- **Revoked Grants**: Count of `coach_access_grants` where `status = 'revoked'`
- **Churn Rate**: `(Revoked grants) / (Total grants)` × 100

#### Engagement Metrics
- **Average Students per Coach**: `(Total active grants) / (Coaches with students)`
- **Session Views by Coaches**: Track API calls to `/api/player/[id]/sessions` with `access_type = 'coach'`
- **Coach Dashboard Daily Active Users (DAU)**
- **ContactsPage Daily Active Users (DAU)**

#### Referral Metrics
- **Auto-Friendships Created**: Count of friendships where `source = 'referral'`
- **Referral Chain Depth**: Distribution of players by `referrer_level_1` through `referrer_level_5`
- **Most Active Referrers**: Top 10 players by `total_referrals`

### Database Queries for Monitoring

#### Daily Metrics
```sql
-- Coach adoption rate
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT coach_player_id) as total_coaches,
  COUNT(*) as total_active_grants,
  COUNT(*) / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT coach_player_id), 0) as avg_students_per_coach
FROM coach_access_grants
WHERE status = 'active';

-- New grants today
SELECT COUNT(*) as new_grants_today
FROM coach_access_grants
WHERE granted_at >= CURRENT_DATE;

-- Revocations today
SELECT COUNT(*) as revocations_today
FROM coach_access_grants
WHERE revoked_at >= CURRENT_DATE;
```

#### Weekly Report
```sql
-- Grants created this week
SELECT DATE(granted_at) as day, COUNT(*) as grants
FROM coach_access_grants
WHERE granted_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(granted_at)
ORDER BY day;

-- Top coaches by student count
SELECT
  p.display_name,
  p.email,
  COUNT(*) as student_count
FROM coach_access_grants cag
INNER JOIN players p ON cag.coach_player_id = p.player_id
WHERE cag.status = 'active'
GROUP BY p.player_id
ORDER BY student_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Monitoring Alerts

**Critical Alerts:**
- API error rate > 5% on any coach access endpoint
- Response time > 2s (p95) for `/api/contacts/friends`
- Zero new coach grants for 7 consecutive days (may indicate feature issue)

**Warning Alerts:**
- Grant revocation rate > 20% in a single day (investigate why)
- Coach dashboard page load time > 3s (performance degradation)
