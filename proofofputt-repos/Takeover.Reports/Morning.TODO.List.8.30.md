## üéØ **CRITICAL FINDINGS: FRONTEND-BACKEND MISMATCH**

### **‚úÖ FRONTEND READY - BACKEND INCOMPLETE**
The frontend has **MORE features** implemented than the backend supports:

**Frontend Components Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ Password reset workflow (ResetPasswordPage.jsx)
- ‚úÖ Fundraising system (FundraiserCreatePage.jsx, FundraiserDetailPage.jsx, PledgeModal.jsx)
- ‚úÖ Advanced user management (LoginPage.jsx, NotificationsPage.jsx)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced UX features (Pagination.jsx, SortButton.jsx, UpgradePage.jsx)

**Backend API Gaps:**
- ‚ùå **Missing:** `/forgot-password` endpoint
- ‚ùå **Missing:** `/reset-password` endpoint  
- ‚ùå **Missing:** All fundraiser endpoints (`/fundraisers/*`)
- ‚ùå **Missing:** Pledge system endpoints
- ‚ùå **Missing:** Enhanced notification endpoints

## üìã **HIGH PRIORITY TODOS FOR NEXT SESSION**

### **üö® CRITICAL: Complete Backend API Implementation**

#### **1. Password Recovery System (BLOCKING USER ONBOARDING)**
- [ ] **Implement** `/forgot-password` POST endpoint in `api.py`
- [ ] **Implement** `/reset-password` POST endpoint in `api.py`
- [ ] **Add email utility integration** for password reset emails
- [ ] **Test** frontend ResetPasswordPage.jsx with backend endpoints

**Impact:** Users cannot recover forgotten passwords - blocking user acquisition

#### **2. Fundraising System (REVENUE FEATURE)**
- [ ] **Implement** `/fundraisers` GET/POST endpoints
- [ ] **Implement** `/fundraisers/<id>` GET endpoint  
- [ ] **Implement** `/fundraisers/<id>/pledge` POST endpoint
- [ ] **Add database schema** for fundraisers and pledges tables
- [ ] **Test** fundraising workflow end-to-end

**Impact:** Missing major revenue stream and user engagement feature

#### **3. Enhanced Notifications (USER RETENTION)**
- [ ] **Review** current notification endpoints vs frontend needs
- [ ] **Extend** notification system for fundraising alerts
- [ ] **Add** real-time notification support if needed

**Impact:** Reduced user engagement and retention

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **RISK MITIGATION**

### **Technical Risks**
- **Database Connection:** Ensure PostgreSQL connection works in live environment
- **YOLO Model:** Verify model file loads and performs accurately
- **Camera Access:** Test camera permissions on target hardware
- **API Endpoints:** Complete missing backend endpoints before user testing

### **Business Risks**
- **User Onboarding:** Password recovery system needed for user acquisition
- **Revenue Generation:** Fundraising system needed for business model validation
- **Competitive Advantage:** Missing features could delay market entry

---

## üö® **CRITICAL REMINDER**

**The major technical lifts are COMPLETE.** The system architecture is solid and scalable. The remaining work is:

1. **Backend API completion** (estimated 2-4 hours)
2. **Integration testing** (estimated 1-2 hours)  
3. **Live system validation** (estimated 1-2 hours)

**Total remaining development: 4-8 hours before market-ready system**

After completing these items, focus shifts entirely to **business execution** - user acquisition, partnerships, and revenue optimization.
