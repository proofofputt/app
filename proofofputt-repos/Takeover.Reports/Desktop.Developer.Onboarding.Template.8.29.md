## üõ†Ô∏è **TECHNICAL SETUP GUIDE**

### **Repository Access Setup**
```bash
# 1. Accept GitHub repository invitation
# You'll receive: https://github.com/[org]/proof-of-putt-desktop-dev

# 2. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/[org]/proof-of-putt-desktop-dev.git
cd proof-of-putt-desktop-dev

# 3. Verify access level
ls -la desktop/src-tauri/src/
# You should see allowed directories only

# 4. Run setup script
chmod +x scripts/setup.sh
./scripts/setup.sh
```

### **Development Environment Verification**
```bash
# Install dependencies
cd desktop
npm install

# Verify Tauri setup
npm run tauri --version
# Should output: tauri-cli x.x.x

# Test development build
npm run tauri dev
# Application should launch with mock CV data
```

### **Mock Development Environment**
```rust
// You'll work with mock interfaces like this:
// desktop/src-tauri/src/computer_vision/mock.rs

pub struct MockComputerVision {
    // Simulated computer vision for development
    // Real implementation is restricted
}

impl MockComputerVision {
    pub fn detect_ball(&self, frame: &[u8]) -> DetectionResult {
        // Mock implementation returns realistic test data
        DetectionResult {
            detected: true,
            confidence: 0.95,
            position: (320, 240),
            timestamp: SystemTime::now()
        }
    }
}
```

## üìö **DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES**

### **Code Standards**
- **Rust**: Follow standard rustfmt formatting
- **React**: Use functional components with hooks
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, full type coverage
- **Testing**: Unit tests required for new features
- **Documentation**: Inline comments for complex logic

### **Git Workflow**
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 2. Make changes (only in allowed directories)
# Edit files, test locally

# 3. Commit with descriptive messages
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add session statistics display component

- Add responsive chart component for session data
- Implement real-time data updates
- Add accessibility attributes"

# 4. Push and create pull request
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
# Create PR on GitHub - requires owner approval
```

### **Testing Requirements**
```bash
# Frontend tests
cd desktop && npm test

# Rust backend tests (where accessible)
cd desktop/src-tauri && cargo test

# Integration tests
npm run test:e2e
```
