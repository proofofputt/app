# Admin Feedback System - Implementation Complete

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive implementation of the advanced feedback system with admin management capabilities, email notifications, priority-based triaging, and bulk operations.

## Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Admin Response Interface
- **Admin Dashboard** at `/admin/feedback` with full thread management
- View all feedback threads with filtering by status, priority, and category
- Individual thread detail view with message history
- Admin response capability with automatic email notifications to users
- Thread status and priority management
- Admin notes for internal documentation
- Bulk operations for managing multiple threads

### 2. ✅ Email Notifications
Automated emails sent via SendGrid for:
- **User Confirmation**: When new feedback is submitted
- **Admin Response**: When admin replies to user's feedback
- **Status Updates**: When feedback status changes (open → in_progress → resolved → closed)
- **High-Priority Alerts**: When high/critical priority feedback is created (sent to admin team)

All emails use branded templates matching Proof of Putt design with green gradient headers.

### 3. ✅ Priority-Based Triaging
Auto-assignment rules based on category:
- `bug_report` → **HIGH** priority
- `performance` → **HIGH** priority
- `support` → **NORMAL** priority
- `feature_request` → **LOW** priority
- `general_feedback`, `page_issue`, `ui_ux`, `other` → **NORMAL** priority

Admins can manually override priority at any time.

### 4. ✅ Bulk Operations & Reporting
- **Bulk Status Updates**: Mark multiple threads as in_progress, resolved, etc.
- **Bulk Priority Changes**: Set priority for multiple threads at once
- **Dashboard Statistics**:
  - Thread counts by status, priority, category
  - Average and median response times
  - Recent activity (24h, 7d, 30d)
  - Threads needing attention (unanswered)
  - High priority open threads
  - Total threads and messages
  - Top users by feedback submissions
  - Common issues by page/feature area

### 5. ❌ File Attachments
**Deliberately excluded** per user request due to security concerns. The JSONB field in the database remains unused.

## Files Created/Modified

### Backend - Database
- ✅ `database/add_admin_role.sql` - Adds `is_admin` column to players table with indexes

### Backend - Middleware
- ✅ `utils/adminAuth.js` - Admin verification middleware with `requireAdmin()` wrapper

### Backend - API Endpoints
- ✅ `api/admin/feedback.js` - Main admin endpoint (GET all threads, PATCH update, POST bulk update)
- ✅ `api/admin/feedback-stats.js` - Dashboard statistics endpoint
- ✅ `api/admin/feedback-respond.js` - Admin response endpoint with email trigger
- ✅ `api/user-feedback.js` - Enhanced with auto-priority and email triggers

### Backend - Email Service
- ✅ `utils/emailService.js` - Added 4 new email templates:
  - `sendFeedbackConfirmationEmail()`
  - `sendFeedbackResponseEmail()`
  - `sendFeedbackStatusUpdateEmail()`
  - `sendNewFeedbackAlertEmail()`

### Frontend - API Client
- ✅ `src/api.js` - Added 5 admin API functions:
  - `apiAdminGetAllFeedback()`
  - `apiAdminUpdateThread()`
  - `apiAdminBulkUpdateThreads()`
  - `apiAdminGetFeedbackStats()`
  - `apiAdminRespondToThread()`

### Frontend - Components
- ✅ `src/pages/AdminFeedbackPage.jsx` - Full admin dashboard component (700+ lines)
- ✅ `src/pages/AdminFeedbackPage.css` - Comprehensive styling (600+ lines)
- ✅ `src/App.jsx` - Added `/admin/feedback` route
- ✅ `src/components/ProfileDropdown.jsx` - Added "Admin Dashboard" menu item for admin users
- ✅ `src/components/ProfileDropdown.css` - Styling for admin menu item

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Migration
Run the SQL migration to add admin role support:

```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -f database/add_admin_role.sql
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Add to your `.env` or Vercel environment variables:

```bash
# Comma-separated list of admin email addresses for high-priority alerts
ADMIN_EMAILS=pop@proofofputt.com
```

**Note**: `SENDGRID_API_KEY` should already be configured.

### 3. Set Admin Users
Update specific player accounts to grant admin access:

```sql
UPDATE players SET is_admin = true WHERE email = 'pop@proofofputt.com';
```

### 4. Deploy Code
All backend and frontend code is ready to deploy:

```bash
# From the app directory
npm run build        # Build frontend
vercel deploy --prod # Deploy to production
```

### 5. Verify Email Configuration
Test that SendGrid emails are sending correctly:
1. Submit test feedback as a user
2. Verify confirmation email received
3. Respond as admin
4. Verify response email received
5. Update status
6. Verify status update email received

## Usage Guide

### For Admin Users

1. **Access Admin Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to `/admin/feedback` or click "Admin Dashboard" in profile menu
   - Only users with `is_admin = true` can access

2. **View All Feedback**:
   - See all feedback threads from all users
   - Filter by status, priority, or category
   - Use pagination for large datasets (50 per page)

3. **Manage Individual Thread**:
   - Click on any thread subject to view details
   - View all messages in conversation
   - Send admin response (automatically emails user)
   - Update status (open → in_progress → resolved → closed)
   - Change priority (critical, high, normal, low)
   - Add admin notes for internal reference

4. **Bulk Operations**:
   - Select multiple threads using checkboxes
   - Apply status or priority changes to all selected
   - Useful for batch processing similar issues

5. **Monitor Statistics**:
   - Dashboard shows key metrics at top
   - Track response times and workload
   - Identify threads needing attention

### For Regular Users

Users interact with feedback through the existing `/comments` page:
- Submit new feedback (auto-assigned priority)
- Receive email confirmation
- View conversation history
- Reply to admin responses
- Get notified when status changes

## Email Notification Flow

### User Submits Feedback
1. User fills out form on `/comments` page
2. System auto-assigns priority based on category
3. Thread created in database
4. **Email sent**: Confirmation to user
5. **If high/critical priority**: Alert email to all `ADMIN_EMAILS`

### Admin Responds
1. Admin types response in dashboard
2. Message saved to database
3. Status auto-updated to "in_progress" (if currently "open")
4. **Email sent**: Response notification to user

### Status Updated
1. Admin changes thread status (e.g., open → resolved)
2. Status saved in database
3. **Email sent**: Status update notification to user
4. If status = "closed", includes admin_notes in email

## Security Features

### Admin Authentication
- All admin endpoints protected by `requireAdmin()` middleware
- Verifies JWT token AND `is_admin` database flag
- Returns 401 if not authenticated, 403 if not admin
- Frontend component checks `playerData.is_admin` and shows access denied

### Email Safety
- No file attachments (per security requirement)
- All email sending is in try/catch - failures don't break API
- Email addresses validated against player database
- Admin emails from environment variable (not user input)

### Input Validation
- Category whitelist validation
- Required fields enforced (subject, category, message)
- SQL parameterized queries (no injection risk)
- Transaction safety with BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexes
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_players_admin ON players(is_admin) WHERE is_admin = true;
CREATE INDEX idx_feedback_admin_view ON feedback_threads(status, priority, created_at DESC);
```

### Query Optimizations
- Pagination limits result sets (default 50, max 100)
- JOIN queries fetch related data in single round-trip
- Aggregations use PostgreSQL functions (COUNT, AVG, PERCENTILE_CONT)
- LATERAL joins for complex aggregations

### Frontend Optimizations
- Conditional rendering based on admin status
- Efficient state management with React hooks
- Debounced filter changes
- Lazy loading of thread details

Admin Response Form → POST /api/admin/feedback-respond
  ↓
requireAdmin middleware (verify admin role)
  ↓
Get thread details + player info
  ↓
INSERT feedback_messages (is_admin_response = true, player_id = NULL)
  ↓
If status = 'open': UPDATE to 'in_progress'
  ↓
Send response email to user
  ↓
Return success response
```

### Data Flow: Status Update
```
Admin Edit Form → PATCH /api/admin/feedback
  ↓
requireAdmin middleware
