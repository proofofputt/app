Lead Dev Claude rules
1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Finally, add a review section to the [todo.md]. file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.

## End-to-End Data Flow Documentation

### Complete Session Data Journey
```
[Desktop App] 
    ↓ (Session Recording & CV Analysis)
[Real-time Calculations]
    ↓ (Session Statistics Object)
[API Upload via POST /api/upload-session]
    ↓ (Data Validation & Processing)
[PostgreSQL Database (NeonDB)]
    ↓ (Query via API endpoints)
[Web Dashboard Display]
    ↓ (Formatted User Interface)
[Competition & Analytics]
```

### Data Capture & Processing Pipeline

#### 1. Session Recording (Desktop App)
**Real-time CV Processing:**
- Ball position tracking using YOLO object detection
- Make/miss classification via ML models
- Timing analysis for streak detection
- Performance metric calculations

**Live Statistics Calculated:**
- Total putts attempted and makes/misses
- Make percentage with 2-decimal precision
- Best consecutive streak tracking
- Session duration in decimal seconds
- Performance rates (PPM/MPM - Putts/Makes Per Minute)
- Advanced metrics (Most makes in 60s, Fastest 21 consecutive)

#### 2. Session Data Object Structure
```javascript
{
  total_putts: 5,
  total_makes: 3,
  total_misses: 2,
  make_percentage: 60.0,
  best_streak: 3,
  session_duration_seconds: 6.5,
  putts_per_minute: 46.15,
  makes_per_minute: 27.69,
  most_makes_in_60_seconds: 3,
  fastest_21_makes: null,
  date_recorded: "2025-09-05T18:39:39.102Z"
}
```

#### 3. Upload & Authentication System
**Desktop Upload Mode:**
- Header: `x-desktop-upload: true`
- No JWT authentication required
- Direct session data transmission

**Web Upload Mode:**
- Header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- JWT validation with player ownership verification
- Secure session data handling

#### 4. Database Storage Architecture
**Sessions Table Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE sessions (
    session_id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,      -- UUID string
    player_id INTEGER NOT NULL,               -- Player reference
    data JSONB NOT NULL,                      -- Complete session data
    stats_summary JSONB,                      -- Extracted key metrics
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,     -- Upload timestamp
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE      -- Last modification
);
```

**Automated Player Stats Aggregation:**
```sql
-- Real-time stat updates on each session upload
UPDATE player_stats SET
  total_sessions = total_sessions + 1,
  total_putts = total_putts + NEW.total_putts,
  total_makes = total_makes + NEW.total_makes,
  best_streak = GREATEST(best_streak, NEW.best_streak),
  make_percentage = (total_makes / total_putts) * 100
```

#### 5. API Data Transformation
**Database → Frontend Field Mapping:**

| Database Field | API Response | Display Format |
|---|---|---|
| `data.total_putts` | `total_putts` | Integer |
| `data.total_makes` | `makes` | Integer |
| `data.best_streak` | `best_streak` | Integer |
| `data.session_duration_seconds` | `duration` | "MM:SS" |
| `data.putts_per_minute` | `ppm` | Decimal (2 places) |
| `data.most_makes_in_60_seconds` | `most_in_60s` | Integer |

**Duration Formatting Function:**
```javascript
function formatDuration(seconds) {
  const totalSeconds = Math.round(seconds);
  const minutes = Math.floor(totalSeconds / 60);
  const remainingSeconds = totalSeconds % 60;
  return `${minutes.toString().padStart(2, '0')}:${remainingSeconds.toString().padStart(2, '0')}`;
}
```

### Critical Technical Implementation Notes

#### Session ID Management
- **Format**: UUID v4 (`e95aa70c-c77d-4032-a024-c24db98f730e`)
- **Database Type**: VARCHAR(255) - NOT INTEGER
- **Uniqueness**: Primary key constraint with upsert pattern

#### Error Handling & Edge Cases
- **Zero-value sessions**: Allowed for practice/calibration
- **Missing data**: Default values prevent crashes
- **Database failures**: Graceful error responses with logging
- **CORS Configuration**: Wildcard origin for development

#### Production Readiness Checklist
- ✅ **UUID session IDs**: Proper VARCHAR(255) implementation
- ✅ **JSONB storage**: Efficient data and stats_summary columns
- ✅ **Authentication**: Dual-mode (desktop/web) handling
- ✅ **Data validation**: Comprehensive field verification
- ✅ **Performance optimization**: Strategic indexing and caching

## Known Issues & Troubleshooting

### ✅ **Recently Resolved Critical Issues**

#### **Competition & Fairness**
- **✅ Fair-Play Timer Logic**: Restored prototype timer mechanism - timer now starts only on first putt attempt (ball transition from mat to ramp) ensuring competitive integrity for timed sessions
- **✅ Dashboard Stats "N/A" Display**: Fixed unified player data loading with comprehensive `/api/player/[id]/data.js` endpoint
- **✅ League Round Scheduling**: Implemented automated round management with countdown timers and desktop integration

#### **Data Processing & APIs**  
- **✅ Career Stats JSON Processing**: Fixed array aggregation for Makes/Misses by category classifications
- **✅ Leaderboard v2 Deployment**: Advanced ranking system with fallback queries when stored procedures unavailable
- **✅ API Routing Conflicts**: Resolved Vercel deployment conflicts between `/api/player/[id]/*` endpoints

### 🔧 Current Technical Issues

#### **Desktop Application**
- **Auto-upload Failures**: Missing `/api/upload-session` endpoint
  - **Status**: Needs implementation for CV session data upload
  - **Workaround**: Manual session data export available
  - **Priority**: Medium - desktop sessions work, just no auto-sync

#### **Web Application**
- **Form Accessibility Warnings**: Missing autocomplete attributes
  - **Solution**: Add `autoComplete` props to password inputs
  - **Impact**: Accessibility compliance and user experience
  - **Priority**: Low - functional but not optimal

- **Performance Optimizations**: Potential WebSocket integration
  - **Solution**: Consider WebSockets for real-time features
  - **Impact**: Enhanced real-time competition experience
  - **Priority**: Future enhancement

### ⚖️ **Fair-Play Timer System**

**Competitive Integrity**: Timer starts only on first putt attempt (mat→ramp transition), ensuring fair time for players to move from computer to putting mat.

**Implementation**: `run_tracker.py` sets `session_start_time_local = None` initially, begins timing when `PuttClassifier` detects ball transition from `PUTTING_MAT_ROI` to `RAMP_ROI`  
**Integration**: Applied to duels and league rounds, eliminates setup-time advantage

### 🏥 Support & Resolution Priorities
1. **Critical (0-24h)**: Auth failures, data loss, security issues
2. **High (1-3 days)**: Competition features, user experience blockers  
3. **Medium (1-2 weeks)**: Performance optimization, accessibility
4. **Low (Future releases)**: Feature enhancements, nice-to-have improvements
